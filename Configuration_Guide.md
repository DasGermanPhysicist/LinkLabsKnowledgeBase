> Establish the basic account structure and administrative access for new customers.

#### Create Customer Account
1. **Access Link Labs Manager portal**
   - Navigate to the Link Labs Manager interface
   - Use administrative credentials to access provisioning tools
   
2. **Input customer information and contact details**
   - Complete customer profile with accurate contact information
   - Set up billing and subscription parameters
   - Configure initial user accounts and permissions

3. **Portal Configuration**
   - Customize dashboard layout for election use cases
   - Set up organizational structure and asset categories
   - Configure notification preferences and alert recipients
   - Establish reporting schedules and formats

> [!tip] Account Setup Best Practices
> - Use consistent naming conventions for assets and locations
> - Set up role-based access from the beginning
> - Configure backup administrators for redundancy

### Step 2: Device Provisioning

#### SuperTag Configuration

> [!device] Device Setup
> Configure SuperTag devices for optimal performance in election environments.

**Basic Settings**
```yaml
Device Configuration:
  - Device ID: Use consistent naming convention
  - Location Update Frequency: 5-15 minutes (recommended for elections)
  - Battery Optimization: Balanced mode for election periods
  - Cellular Connectivity: Verify carrier compatibility
```

**Election-Specific Settings**
```yaml
Election Configuration:
  - Geofencing: 10-meter precision boundaries for election facilities
  - Tamper Detection: Medium sensitivity for ballot boxes
  - Emergency Alerts: Immediate notification for critical events
  - Chain of Custody: Enable complete audit trail tracking
```

#### BLE Sensor Integration

> [!sensor] Sensor Configuration
> Set up Bluetooth Low Energy sensors for enhanced monitoring capabilities.

**Sensor Pairing Process**
1. **Enable SSF (Sensor Scanning Framework)** on SuperTags
2. **Configure BLE device filters** and MAC addresses
3. **Set up sensor data collection** parameters
4. **Test sensor connectivity** and data flow

**Door Sensor Configuration**
```yaml
Door Sensor Setup:
  Sensor Type: Door/window sensors
  Alert Triggers: 
    - Open/close events
    - Extended open duration (5+ minutes)
  Notification Recipients: Election officials
  Audit Trail: All access events logged
```

> [!warning] Sensor Range Limitations
> BLE sensors must be within 50 feet of SuperTag devices. Plan sensor placement accordingly and test connectivity before deployment.

## 🗳️ Election Use Case Configuration

### Ballot Box Monitoring

> [!ballot] Ballot Box Security
> Complete configuration for secure ballot box monitoring with tamper detection.

```yaml
Asset Type: Ballot Box
Sensors: Door sensors, tamper detection
Alerts: 
  - Unauthorized access (immediate notification)
  - Extended open duration (5+ minutes)
  - Movement outside designated area
  - Tamper detection activation
Reporting: 
  - Real-time status dashboard
  - Daily security summaries
  - Chain of custody documentation
```

**Configuration Steps**:
1. Create ballot box asset in AirFinder portal
2. Assign SuperTag device with door sensor capability
3. Configure geofencing boundary (10-meter radius recommended)
4. Set up immediate alert notifications for security events
5. Enable comprehensive audit logging

### Voting Machine Tracking

> [!computer] Equipment Security
> Track and monitor voting machines throughout the election process.

```yaml
Asset Type: Voting Machine
Tracking: Location, power status, access events
Alerts:
  - Unauthorized movement outside designated areas
  - Power disconnection during critical periods
  - Access panel opening without authorization
  - Extended offline periods
Reporting: 
  - Chain of custody documentation
  - Equipment utilization reports
  - Security event summaries
```

**Configuration Steps**:
1. Create voting machine assets with unique identifiers
2. Configure location tracking with 5-minute update intervals
3. Set up movement alerts between authorized locations
4. Enable power status monitoring if supported
5. Configure custody transfer notifications

### Secure Material Custody

> [!lock] Sensitive Materials
> Monitor ballot bags, thumb drives, and other sensitive election materials.

```yaml
Asset Type: Ballot bags, thumb drives, sensitive documents
Tracking: Location, custody transfers, environmental conditions
Alerts:
  - Unauthorized access or movement
  - Temperature/humidity deviations (if sensors available)
  - Custody chain breaks or gaps
  - Extended periods outside secure areas
Reporting: 
  - Complete audit trails
  - Compliance reports for regulatory requirements
  - Chain of custody documentation
```

## ⚙️ Feature Configuration Options

### Location Tracking Settings

> [!location] Positioning Configuration
> Optimize location tracking for election environment requirements.

- **Update Frequency**: 1 minute to 24 hours (election default: 5 minutes)
- **Accuracy Mode**: High precision (GPS + WiFi + Cellular)
- **Power Management**: Balanced mode for election periods
- **Geofencing**: Custom boundaries with 10-meter precision

> [!note] Battery Life Considerations
> More frequent location updates reduce battery life. Balance tracking needs with operational duration requirements.

### Alert Configuration

> [!bell] Notification Management
> Set up comprehensive alerting for election security events.

- **Immediate Alerts**: SMS, email, push notifications
- **Escalation Rules**: Multiple notification levels with time-based escalation
- **Alert Recipients**: Primary and backup contacts for redundancy
- **Quiet Hours**: Configurable for non-election periods

**Alert Priority Levels**:
- **Critical**: Security breaches, unauthorized access
- **High**: Equipment movement, extended open periods
- **Medium**: Battery warnings, connectivity issues
- **Low**: Routine status updates, maintenance reminders

### Reporting Options

> [!chart] Data and Analytics
> Configure reporting to meet election compliance and operational requirements.

- **Real-time Dashboard**: Live status and alerts for active monitoring
- **Scheduled Reports**: Daily, weekly, monthly summaries
- **Audit Reports**: Complete chain of custody documentation
- **Compliance Reports**: Regulatory requirement adherence
