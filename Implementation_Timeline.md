# Implementation Timeline

> [!info] Navigation
> ← Back to [[index|Partner Support Index]]

> [!abstract] Overview
> Detailed timeline and milestones for implementing AirFinder Everywhere solutions, from initial consultation through ongoing support operations.

## 📅 Implementation Phases

### Pre-Sale Phase

> [!handshake] Customer Engagement
> Initial customer consultation and solution design process.

1. **Initial Consultation** → **Needs Assessment**
   - Customer requirements gathering
   - Use case identification and mapping
   - Technical feasibility assessment
   - Preliminary solution design

2. **Solution Design** → **Proposal Preparation**
   - Detailed system architecture
	   - SuperTags and BLE tags mapped to assets 
	   - Initial configuration proposed 
	   - Reports and alerts discussed 
   - ROI analysis and pricing structure
   - Implementation timeline development

3. **Proposal Presentation** → **Contract Negotiation**
   - Solution demonstration and validation
   - Implementation planning and resource allocation
   - Final approval and project kickoff

> [!tip] Pre-Sale Best Practices
> - Involve Link Labs Sales Engineering team early in complex deployments
> - Document all customer requirements thoroughly
> - Provide realistic timelines with buffer for contingencies

### Onboarding Phase (1 Week)

> [!rocket] Rapid Deployment
> Fast-track setup for immediate operational capability.

#### Week 1: Foundation Setup
##### Account Setup
- Partner's Support Team 
	- Customer account creation in Link Labs [[AirFinder Portal]]
	- User account provisioning and permissions
	- Initial portal configuration and customization
	- Access credentials distribution and testing
	- Collection of communication endpoints for alerts (emails, phone numbers, teams webhooks etc.)
	- Collection of required geofences
- Link Labs Support Team 
	- Reports and alerts setup 

##### Device Provisioning

> [!Info] Initial Configurations Are Not Final Configurations
> Link Labs asset tracking strives to find the optimum for every customer between a long battery life, low latency, high accuracy and cost. When choosing device configurations, it is usual to start with those that provide longest battery life and lowest cost. See [[Configuration_Guide]]

- Partner's Support Team
	- SuperTag device configuration and testing
		- Are all devices reporting? 
		- Are the configurations as discussed?
	- BLE sensor pairing and validation
		- Are all BLE tags reporting?
	- Initial asset creation and assignment
- Link Labs Support Team 
	- Bulk Geofence setup 
	- Communication testing and verification (specifically for alerts)

##### User Training
- Partner's Support Team 
	- Platform overview and navigation training
	- Basic configuration and monitoring procedures
	- Sensible use of metadata in [[AirFinder Portal]]
	- Geofence creation and change 
	- Documentation and support resource review


### Setup Phase (1-4 Weeks)

> [!construction] Deployment and Validation
> Comprehensive system deployment with thorough testing and validation. Customer communication: it is key to notify the customer that during the setup phase the system will be adjusted to their needs and may go through multiple configuration iterations. It is to be expected that during this phase the system will not behave as it will in a production setting.


#### Week 1: Tag Installation
- **Physical Installation**
	- SuperTag device mounting and placement on all assets
	- BLE sensor installation and positioning on all assets
	- Initial connectivity and range testing

- **System Configuration**
	- Alert configuration and testing
	- Reporting setup and schedule configuration
	- If applicable: Integration testing with customer systems

#### Week 2: Testing and Validation
- **Functional Testing**
	- End-to-end system functionality verification
	- Alert and notification testing under realistic conditions
	- Performance testing under expected load

- **Go-Live Preparation**
	- Final configuration review and optimization

> [!check] Setup Phase Deliverables
> - [ ] All devices installed and operational
> - [ ] System configuration validated and documented
> - [ ] User training completed


> [!Warning] Daily System Checks
> Other than regular check-ins with the customer, it is key to monitor the system closely to ascertain proper function and catch unexpected behaviors early.
