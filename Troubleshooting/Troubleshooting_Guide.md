#### Signal Strength Analysis
1. **Diagnostics**: Use device diagnostics to check cellular signal quality
2. **Dead Zones**: Identify dead zones or interference sources in deployment area
3. **External Antenna**: Consider external antenna or signal booster installation
4. **Carrier Analysis**: Analyze carrier performance in specific locations

#### Network Configuration
1. **APN Settings**: Verify Access Point Name settings for cellular carrier
2. **Carrier Restrictions**: Check for carrier-specific restrictions or limitations
3. **SIM Testing**: Test with different SIM card if available
4. **Roaming**: Verify roaming settings if devices cross carrier boundaries

### Data Accuracy Problems

> [!accuracy] Precision and Reliability Issues
> Address issues with location accuracy and sensor data reliability.

#### Location Accuracy
1. **GPS Satellites**: Check GPS satellite availability and signal quality
2. **WiFi Database**: Verify WiFi access point database updates
3. **Environmental**: Consider environmental factors (buildings, weather, interference)
4. **Calibration**: Perform location calibration in deployment environment

#### Sensor Data Validation
1. **Manual Verification**: Cross-reference sensor data with manual observations
2. **Calibration Drift**: Check sensor calibration and drift over time
3. **Processing Algorithms**: Verify data processing algorithms are appropriate
4. **Environmental Compensation**: Account for environmental factors affecting sensors
